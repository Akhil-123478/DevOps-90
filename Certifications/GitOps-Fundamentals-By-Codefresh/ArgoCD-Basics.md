# Module-2: ArgoCD Basics

### Introduction to ArgoCD

- As a GitOps Controller → [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- ArgoCD implements all the GitOps principles:
    - It is installed as a **controller** in your Kubernetes cluster (the same cluster that it has to manage)
    - ArgoCD is flexible on the types of manifests we can use (stored in Git). 
    It supports:
        - Kubernetes manifests
        - Helm Charts
        - Kustomize definitions
        - Other…..
    - ArgoCD application can be created by defining:
        1. which Git repository to monitor
        2. to which cluster/namespace this application should be installed.
    - From there, ArgoCD monitors the Git repo & whenever there is a change, it automatically bring the deployed cluster to the samt state (desired state)
    - ArgoCD can also deploy applications on other clusters as well

- Argo Family Of Projects:
    1. **ArgoCD** - GitOps Controller
    2. **Argo Rollouts** - Progressive Delivery Controller
    3. **Argo Workflows** - Workflow engine for Kubernetes
    4. **Argo Events** - Event Handling for Kubernetes

### ArgoCD Installation

- ArgoCD is an application itself. Therefore, it needs to be installed
- For production setup, [ArgoCD Auto-pilot](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot) is recommended
- ArgoCD UI can be available to the external traffic via a [Kubernetes Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)
    - **Kubernetes Ingress** - An API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP.

### Hands-On Lab

**01 Setup ArgoCD** (Installing ArgoCD on a cluster)

- We’ll be using simple Kubernetes manifests for the ArgoCD installation.
- In a real cluster you would use a [Helm chart](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/tree/master/charts/argo-cd)
or [Argo CD autopilot](https://argocd-autopilot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) which allows you to manage Argo CD with itself.
- Create a new namespace called argocd:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace argocd
    ```

    - This where Argo CD services and application resources will live.
- Update the config file with this namespace & install argoCD:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codefresh-contrib/gitops-certification-examples/main/argocd-noauth/install.yaml
    ```
    
- View the deployment using:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n argocd
    ```

- By default, Argo CD is only accessible from within the cluster.
- To expose the UI to users you can utilize any of the standard Kubernetes networking mechanisms such as
    - **Ingress** (recommended for production)
    - **Load balancer** (affects cloud cost)
    - **NodePort** (simple but not very flexible)
        - [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
        - An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) as a network service.
        - Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the ***NodePort***)
- Standard NodePort service resource we are using:
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: argocd-server
      managedFields:
      name: argocd-server-nodeport
      namespace: argocd
    spec:
      ports:
      - nodePort: 30443
        port: 8080
        protocol: TCP
      selector:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-server
      type: NodePort
    ```
    
- To apply this in a cluster:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f service.yml
    ```

**Log in the ArgoCD UI**

- Argo CD initially has an admin user with an autogenerated password. You can get the admin password from the default Configmap:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d > admin-pass.txt
    ```
    
- Default username - admin
- You can get the default password from the file `admin-pass.txt`
    
    ```bash
    cat admin-pass.txt
    ```
